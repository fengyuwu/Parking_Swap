-Google+ sign in was scratched for now. A switch to facebook sign in was made.  Hopefully we get Google+ sign in 
  working in addition to Facebook sign in before the end of sprint 5. 
-Everyone on back end went through the "Hello world" for python tutorial for creating a lambda function.
  Issues with installing the bundle for python and pip were resolved by installing each piece manually.
  Everyone succesfully configured their triggers and completed the tutorial. 
-Individual preliminary tasks for the back-end were assigned.

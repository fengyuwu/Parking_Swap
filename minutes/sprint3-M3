-Google+ sign in was scratched for now. A switch to facebook sign in was made. Users can now sign into 
ParkingSwap using their facebook account. Hopefully we get Google+ sign in working in addition to Facebook
sign in before the end of sprint 5. 

-Everyone on back end went through the "Hello world(python)" tutorial for creating a lambda function.
  Issues with installing the bundle for python and pip were resolved by installing each piece manually.
  Everyone succesfully configured their trigger and completed the tutorial. 
  
-Individual preliminary tasks for the back-end were assigned.  Each Group member should be able to create an issue 
on github for this sprint after meeting today.

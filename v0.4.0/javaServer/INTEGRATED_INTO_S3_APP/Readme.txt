I organized the package structure to something more conventional so things are sensibly grouped. Merging at the end of Sprint 4 would break the code on the branch so it will be integrated early in Sprint 5 when everyone will be on board with the change.

When integrated, the app will be able to utilize the classes that deal with file transfer with S3 buckets for user-specific private storage.
